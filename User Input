# Example 1:  
# Output: Hello X! You are Y 

# X is stored as name and Y is stored as age.  

name = input("Enter your name: ")   # The user input will be stored as name.  
age = input("Enter your age: ")   # The user input will be stored as age.  

print("Hello " + name + "! You are " + age) 


# Example 2:  
# The following code functions as a calculator that adds two numbers.  

# Output: The sum X + Y 

# X is stored as num1 and Y is stored as num2.  

num1 = input("Enter a number: ")   # The user inputs a number, but it is converted to string.  
num2 = input("Enter another number: ")   # This number will also be converted to string.  
result = float(num1) + float(num2)   # float() converts string to decimal numbers.   

print(result) 


# Example 3:  

''' 
Output: Roses are X 
    Y are blue 
    I love Z 
''' 

# X is stored as color, Y is stored as plural_noun, Y is stored as celebrity.  

color = input("Enter a color: ") 
plural_noun = input("Enter a plural noun: ") 
celebrity = input("Enter a celebrity: ") 

print("Roses are " + color)
